# Policies, Terms, and Legal Stuff

The rough print and the fine print. We try to make all our policies as clear, fair, and readable as possible.

* [Privacy policy](privacy/index.md)
* [Privacy Regulations reference](privacy/regulations/index.md)
* [Cancellation policy](cancellation/index.md)
* [Refund policy](refund/index.md)
* [Use Restrictions policy](abuse.md)
* [Security overview](security/index.md)
* [Until the End of the Internet](until-the-end-of-the-internet/index.md)

## A Note About the Email Addresses

If you try to click on any of the Support links in this repository, you'll get a 404 page. Don't despair! You can always reach us at support@hundeloh-consulting.ch.

So how come the links don't work in this repository? The short answer is: we made a technical tradeoff. The long answer is, we copy the policies in this repository to our product marketing sites. To make it easier to transfer, we are now using relative links, [this Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links) to convert Markdown links to a valid web URL, and some [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) variables.

## Public Contributions Welcome

We welcome our customers—you!—to suggest changes to our policies and to offer feedback on the changes we have planned. Please do chime in on any open pull request, or even file a pull request yourself.


## Thanks

Thanks to Basecamp for making their policies [open-source](https://github.com/basecamp/policies).
